# The-last-transmission
The theme of my story, "The Last Transmission," is about isolation, perseverance, and the power of human connection even in the most extreme circumstances. It follows Commander Alex, an astronaut stranded near a black hole, as they struggle to survive and send fragmented messages back to Earth.
